# Basic Networking Terms

## What is a Network?

- A computer network is a digital telecommunications network for **sharing resources** between nodes, which are computing devices that use a common telecommunications technology.

- Data transmission between nodes is supported over data links consisting of physical cable media, such as twisted pair or fibre-optic cables, or by wireless methods, such as Wi-Fi, microwave transmission, or free-space optical communication.

## MAC address

A media access control address (MAC address) is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment.

This use is common in most IEEE 802 networking technologies, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.

## Modulation

Modulation is the process of varying one or more properties of a periodic waveform, called the carrier signal, with a modulating signal that typically contains information to be transmitted.

Most radio systems in the 20th century used frequency modulation (FM) or amplitude modulation (AM) for radio broadcast.

## Cat

Cat = Category of cable.

In general, higher numbers represent faster speeds and higher frequencies, measured in Mhz.

---

## What is a Server?

- In computing, a server is a computer program or a device that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called **clients**

- This architecture is called the client-server model, and a single overall computation is distributed across multiple processes or devices.

---

## What is a Client?

- A client is a piece of computer hardware or software that accesses a service made available by a server.

- The server is often on another computer system, in which case the client accesses the service by way of a network.

## Protocols

HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol, Uses Port 80

HTTPS: Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. Uses Port 443

FTP: File Transfer Protocol, Uses Port 21 (and 20)

---

## Attenuation

Attenuation refers to the reduction in the strength or intensity of a signal. The longer the distance the less strong signal.

---

## Bridge / Switch

Bridge = learns MAC addresses in software

Switch = learns MAC addresses much more quickly by using hardware ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits)

---

## LAN

A local area network (LAN) is a computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area such as a residence, school, laboratory, university campus or office building.

---

## Router / Switch

A router will route from one IP network to another.
e.g. from physical ethernet to wireless

Switch is a layer 3 switch, because it has routing capabilities into it and will route from one VLAN to another VLAN.

---

## Firewalls / IDS

**Firewalls** allow us to stop bad people getting into our network with firewall rules to permit or deny traffic.

**IDS** intrusion detection system simply detects that there is a problem and then alerts you that there is a problem and then you have to do something about it

**IPS** can alert you that there is a problem but also block the attack, it sits inline with the traffic of data.
